# nostrnode-cli

‚ö†Ô∏è üõ† nostrnode is alpha and under active development. Use at your own risk. Please open issues, submit PR's or reach out.

## What problem does nostrnode solve?
Using multiple Tor endpoints for multiple Bitcoin related services over http simultaneously via a light client is too often
a slow, painful experience.

## What does nostrnode do?
nostrnode receives encrypted rpc commands intended for Core Lightning, Join Market and Bitcoin Core. 
nostrnode decrypts the command, builds the http request for localhost and forwards it to the correct service (identified 
by port for now). nostrnode takes the response from said service, encrypts it, packages it into a nostr event and sends 
it to the relay which forwards it to the client.

## Why nostrnode?

### Don't trust verify.
nostr uses a bitcoin private/public keypair to sign and verify all messages it sends and receives. Before any url request
touches the internet it is first encapsulated into a nostr event which we signed/verified with our keypair. This is beneficial
because it ensures no middle man has altered your messages. We verify all events locally and ignore them if they are invalid.
We have more layers of security then only relying on ssl (or whatever), you could even use http and your traffic content is still
encrypted.

### easy to use
Easy to configure and requires no real setup by the client at all other than running the required services
and installing nostrnode. Rpc credentials are produced by nostrnode so that users can add them to their bitcoin.conf, as is the
ssl cert required by Join Market and the master key required by Sparko (Core Lightning). Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning
(thanks to Sparko) support fine-grained permissions.

Users can easily run their own nostr relay to gain even more privacy, speed and reliability. They are very easy to spin up
and use minimal resources.

To connect, light clients need a keypair (which the client creates) and a subscription key to nostrnode (which nostrnode 
creates) to gain access to all services. At present light clients require an array of sensitive, plain text credentials 
to connect which is messy from a UX perspective and could be less secure. Users must be extremely careful how they store 
their private key, if the keys are compromised you are screwed! Clients should obviously handle the nostr keys themselves, 
however the encryption key ought to be created out of band.

If a user wants to stop remote access they just quit nostrnode, all services will remain running with rpc only exposed to 
`localhost`. nostrnode is hardcoded to only issue rpc to `localhost`. There is no need to forward any ports or configure 
anything on the client side.

### It's fast!
Websockets are faster than http requests, user's connection to their node should be more reliable too. nostr has an always 
on, always there, instant feel to it.

## Why nostr?
- Websockets are fast
from the nostr readme:
- "The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global "social" network once and for all."
- "It doesn't rely on any trusted central server, hence it is resilient; it is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, 
   so it is tamper-proof; it does not rely on P2P techniques, therefore it works."

I see nostr as a decentralized network where we can broadcast data to each other in a censorship resistant way. It seems
like the perfect medium for Bitcoin light clients and servers to communicate over. If nostr gains traction (I think it will) 
potentially all Bitcoin related network traffic can be obfuscated in a sea of nostr "social" apps.

## Installation
You need python 3.9.
```bash
git clone nostrnode-cli...
cd nostrnode-cli
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python3 nostrnode.py
```
